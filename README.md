Its general goal is to get as close as possible to path-traced reference at real-time rates in dynamic scenes, without any precomputed light transport, or manually placed light probes.

`kajiya` does not currently aim to be a fully-featured renderer used to ship games, support all sorts of scenes, lighting phenomena, or a wide range of hardware. It's a hobby project, takes a lot of shortcuts, and is perpetually a work in progress.

## Features

* Hybrid rendering using a mixture of raster, compute, and ray-tracing
* Dynamic global illumination
    * Multi-bounce temporally-recurrent voxel-based diffuse
    * Short-range ray-traced diffuse for high-frequency details
    * Single bounce specular, falling back to diffuse after the first hit
* Sun with ray-traced soft shadows
* Standard PBR with GGX and roughness/metalness
    * Energy-preserving multi-scattering BRDF
* Reference path-tracing mode
* Temporal super-resolution and anti-aliasing
* Natural tone mapping
* Physically-based glare
* Basic motion blur
* Contrast-adaptive sharpening
* Optional DLSS support
* GLTF mesh loading (no animations yet)
* A render graph running it all

## Technical overview

* [A quick presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LWo5TtWUAH9d62sGY9Sjmu1JqIs8BsxLbVDxLuhhX8U/edit?usp=sharing) about the renderer
* Repository highlights:
  * HLSL shaders: [`assets/shaders/`](assets/shaders)
  * Rust shaders: [`crates/lib/rust-shaders/`](crates/lib/rust-shaders)
  * Main render graph passes: [`world_render_passes.rs`](crates/lib/kajiya/src/world_render_passes.rs)
* Notable branches:
  * `restir-meets-surfel` - latest experimental branch, with [new GI in the works](https://gist.github.com/h3r2tic/ba39300c2b2ca4d9ca5f6ff22350a037)

## Platforms

`kajiya` currently works on a limited range of operating systems and hardware.

Operating systems:
* Windows
* Linux

Hardware:
* Nvidia RTX series
* Nvidia GTX 1060 and newer (slow: driver-emulated ray-tracing)
* AMD Radeon RX 6000 series

## Building and running

There's a very minimal asset pipeline in `bake.rs`, which converts meshes from GLTF to an internal flat format, and calculates texture mips. In order to bake all the provided meshes, run:

* Windows: `bake.cmd`
* Linux: `./bake.sh`

When done, run the renderer demo (`view` app from `crates/bin/view`) via:

* Windows: `build_and_run.cmd [scene_name]`
* Linux: `./build_and_run.sh [scene_name]`

Where `[scene_name]` is one of the file names in `assets/scenes`, without the `.ron` extension, e.g.:

```
build_and_run.cmd battle
```

or

```
cargo run --bin view --release -- --scene battle --width 1920 --height 1080 --no-debug
```

### Controls in the `view` app

* WSAD, QE - movement
* Mouse + RMB - rotate the camera
* Mouse + LMB - rotate the sun
* Shift - move faster
* Ctrl - move slower
* Space - switch to reference path tracing
* Backspace - reset view to previous saved state
* Tab - show/hide the UI

## Adding Meshes and Scenes

To add new mesh(es), open `bake.cmd` (Win) / `bake.sh` (Linux), and add

* cargo run --bin bake --release -- --scene "[path]" --scale 1.0 -o [mesh_name]

To add new scenes, in `\assets\scenes`, create a `[scene_name].ron` with the following content:

```
(
    instances: [
        (
            position: (0, 0, 0),
            mesh: "[mesh_name]",
        ),
    ]
)
```

* [Working on Rust shaders](docs/rust-shaders.md)
* [Using `kajiya` as a crate](docs/using-kajiya.md)

## Known issues

* Vulkan API usage is extremely basic. Resources are usually not released, and barriers aren't optimal.
* There are hard limit on mesh data and instance counts. Exceeding those limits will result in panics and Vulkan validation errors / driver crashes.
* Window (framebuffer) resizing is not yet implemented.
* The voxel GI uses a fixed-size volume around the origin by default.
    * Use `--gi-volume-scale` to change its extent in the `view` app
    * It can be configured to use camera-centered cascades at an extra performance cost (see `CASCADE_COUNT` and `SCROLL_CASCADES` in [`csgi.rs`](../crates/lib/kajiya/src/renderers/csgi.rs`))
* Denoising needs more work (always).

## Acknowledgments

This project is made possible by the awesome open source Rust community, and benefits from a multitude of crates ðŸ’–ðŸ¦€

Special shout-outs go to:

* Felix Westin for his [MinimalAtmosphere](https://github.com/Fewes/MinimalAtmosphere), which this project uses for sky rendering
* AMD, especially Dominik Baumeister and Guillaume BoissÃ© for the [FidelityFX Shadow Denoiser](https://gpuopen.com/fidelityfx-denoiser/), which forms the basis of shadow denoising in `kajiya`.
* Maik Klein for the Vulkan wrapper [ash](https://github.com/MaikKlein/ash), making it easy for `kajiya` to talk to the GPU.
* Traverse Research and Jasper Bekkers for a number of highly relevant crates:
  * Bindings to the DXC shader compiler: [hassle-rs](https://github.com/Traverse-Research/hassle-rs)
  * SPIR-V reflection utilities: [rspirv-reflect](https://github.com/Traverse-Research/rspirv-reflect)
  * Vulkan memory management: [gpu-allocator](https://github.com/Traverse-Research/gpu-allocator)
  * Blue noise sampling: [blue-noise-sampler](https://github.com/Jasper-Bekkers/blue-noise-sampler)
